		<h4>Our roots</h4>
		<div><p class="open-sans-copy"><i>Growing up biracial is confusing, but growing up biracial in rural Ohio is a whole other story. My sister and I did our best to lean into our Pakistani heritage; we wore gifts from our family in Karachi, read books about Pakistan, and even took Urdu for a few years. The older I got, the more I realized how politicized that identity is. Today, I do my best to stay in touch with that side, but itâ€™s harder the more demonized South Asian people are.</i></p></div>

		<p class="open-sans-copy">For two years, our team, based at Syracuse University, has been analyzing agenda-setting media coverage of those targeted by the American 'War On Terror,' particularly Black, Arab, South Asian, and Muslim men who have come under scrutiny by American law enforcement. We've found that, despite objectivity being an oft-stated goal of our news systems, these men and their communities are often subject to reporting practices that end up vilifying them.</p>

		<p class="open-sans-copy">An important part of our work is making sure that counternarratives exist, particularly for those who have been portrayed as uncomplicated demons in our news and other media.</p>

		<p class="open-sans-copy">Our team is collecting art pieces, photos, poetry, short stories, and any other kinds of media about your experiences during the American 'War On Terror.' Tell us about your families and friends, your communities, your post-9/11 memories, whether upsetting, funny, or anything in between. (One of our team was asked by a middle school classmate if Saddam Hussein was her uncle; unfortunately, no photo exists.)</p>

		<p class="open-sans-copy"><strong>Send us your art, writing, or a high quality (if possible) photo, plus a short description or related story to <a href="mailto:counternarratives2025@gmail.com" target="_blank"> counternarratives2025@gmail.com</a> and, if selected, it'll be displayed at our fall research symposium in Syracuse, New York, alongside the art of political prisoners and incarcerated members of our community. (You will be compensated -- check out our FAQ section below.) None of your photos or stories will be put online without your explicit permission. We may edit displayed stories for length.</strong></p>

		<h1 class="ubuntu-bold">More about our work</h1>
		<p class="open-sans-copy"> Though the current iteration of this work has been in progress for almost two years, the thought processes behind it have been developing for more than a decade. Built atop Jesse J. Norris' idea of "conviction capitalism," as well as Mahmood Mamdani's "good Muslim/bad Muslim" concept, our work is primarily an analysis of how elite news media have portrayed three specific Muslim men: Yassin Aref, Salman Hamdani and Adel Daoud. We are interested in the narratives that were given to readers about these men, and how much those narratives relied on law enforcement's inclusion in the news stories.</p>
		<p class="open-sans-copy"> Two other important parts of our work have been our oral history workshops, conducted in collaboration with Muslim Counterpublics Lab, as well as this photo stories project. Both of these serve to highlight the idea that we do not need to rely only on elite media to tell our stories, particularly when they have proven time and time again that they are not able to do the truth justice.</p>
		<p class="open-sans-copy">Our work will culminate in a symposium this fall in Syracuse, New York.</p>

		<h4>Farzana Aunty</h4>
		<p class="open-sans-copy"><i>Farzana Aunty died when she was 37, in a car accident. She was one of the many people in my childhood who taught my friends and I how to sing, how important beauty is in our faith and how to create it in community. In early 'War on Terror' times, when the mantra was, "Keep your head down," this was a rare message to receive from any adult. The same war is still raging on around us (I'm almost the age she was then, I think about this all the time), but when I sing something in jamatkhana now, and everyone sings with me, it feels like my inside and outside clicking together. </i></p>

			<li><strong>If selected, where will my creative work be displayed?</strong></li>
			<p>Our team is hosting a symposium in Syracuse, New York in the fall to talk about our research. Your art will be printed and displayed at the symposium, along with any text you send us (this may be edited for length or clarity). We also hope to compile select pieces for a web archive on the <a href="https://peacecouncil.net/" target="_blank"> Syracuse Peace Council</a> and <a href="https://lendercenter.syr.edu/">Lender Center</a> websites, as well as a physical zine, which we will mail you.</p>
